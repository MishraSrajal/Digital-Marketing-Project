##📊 AI-Driven Humour in Advertising
#A Bibliometric Analysis Using Scopus, R (Bibliometrix), and VOSviewer

This project investigates how humour in advertising is evolving in the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Using 94 Scopus-indexed publications, the study analyses global research trends, thematic clusters, author networks, and keyword patterns to understand how humour functions within modern AI-enabled marketing environments.

🚀 Overview

Humour has always been a powerful advertising strategy, improving brand recall, emotional engagement, and consumer attitudes. With the rise of AI-driven content creation, humour is now being automated, personalised, and analysed at scale.

This project performs a bibliometric analysis to uncover how researchers across the world are studying this shift, combining:

Marketing

Consumer psychology

Artificial intelligence

Digital communication

The result is a comprehensive map of the research landscape from 1998 to 2025.
