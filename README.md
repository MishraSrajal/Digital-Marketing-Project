###  📊 AI-Driven Humour in Advertising
# A Bibliometric Analysis Using Scopus, R (Bibliometrix), and VOSviewer

This project investigates how humour in advertising is evolving in the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Using 94 Scopus-indexed publications, the study analyses global research trends, thematic clusters, author networks, and keyword patterns to understand how humour functions within modern AI-enabled marketing environments.

🚀 Overview
Humour has always been a powerful advertising strategy, improving brand recall, emotional engagement, and consumer attitudes. With the rise of AI-driven content creation, humour is now being automated, personalised, and analysed at scale.
This project performs a bibliometric analysis to uncover how researchers across the world are studying this shift, combining:
1-Marketing
2-Consumer psychology
3-Artificial intelligence
4-Digital communication
The result is a comprehensive map of the research landscape from 1998 to 2025.
