This study explores how disparagement in humor, particularly in the form of sexist advertising, affects consumer skepticism perceptions when the content is generated by AI compared to human sources. As AI becomes a prominent actor in the creative process, its capacity to produce emotionally charged, humorous content presents opportunities and ethical challenges for persuasive technologies. Using the Persuasion Knowledge Model (PKM) framework, the research focuses on Generation Z, known for their tech-savviness and awareness of social issues, to see how they react to AI- versus human-generated ads containing sexist humor. The results reveal that consumers’ skepticism increases when AI is disclosed in ads, leading to more negative attitudes toward the ad. In the case of sexist humor, this skepticism further reduces the perceived humorousness, which worsens overall advertising evaluations. The study makes three key contributions: (1) it advances theoretical insights into AI-driven persuasive communication, (2) it provides actionable guidance for designers and marketers working with persuasive technologies, and (3) it highlights the ethical imperatives of transparency and social responsibility in algorithmically mediated persuasion, especially as the boundaries between human and machine-generated content continue to blur. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Advertising; Ai Disclosure; Artificial Intelligence; Generation Z; Persuasion; Sexist Humor; Skepticism; Consumer Behavior; Ethical Technology; Social Aspects; Advertizing; Artificial Intelligence Disclosure; Creative Process; Digital World; Exploratory Studies; Generation Z; Persuasion; Persuasive Technology; Sexist Humor; Skepticism; Artificial Intelligence,Consumer behavior; Ethical technology; Social aspects; Advertizing; Artificial intelligence disclosure; Creative process; Digital world; Exploratory studies; Generation Z; Persuasion; Persuasive technology; Sexist humor; Skepticism; Artificial intelligence,,,,"Wu, Linwan, Understanding ai advertising from the consumer perspective what factors determine consumer appreciation of ai-created advertisements?, Journal of Advertising Research, 61, 2, pp. 133-146, (2021); Computers in Human Behavior Artificial Humans, (2024); undefined; Ham, Changdae, How to measure persuasion knowledge, International Journal of Advertising, 34, 1, pp. 17-53, (2015); Obermiller, Carl, Development of a scale to measure consumer skepticism toward advertising, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 7, 2, pp. 159-186, (1998); Jing Wen, Taylor, Activating persuasion knowledge in native advertising: the influence of cognitive load and disclosure language, International Journal of Advertising, 39, 1, pp. 74-93, (2020); Chen, Yaqi, Consumer attitudes toward AI-generated ads: Appeal types, self-efficacy and AI's social role, Journal of Business Research, 185, (2024); Euromonitor International; Wang, Zi, Does personalized advertising have their best interests at heart?

Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to validate Study 1, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to validate Study 2, and PROCESS Model 4 was used to evaluate the mediation functions of attitude and conceptual fluency. The results indicate that firm-generated content (FGC) is more effective than user-generated content (UGC) in terms of university students' engagement - specifically liking (L), sharing (S), and commenting (C) - as well as in fostering green purchase intentions (GPI), particularly with firm-generated storytelling content (FGCS). The mediating role of attitude demonstrates partial or full mediation, except for firm-generated humour content (FGCH), which did not show a significant effect on GPI, but the two promotional modes are not significant difference, however, through the mediating effect of Concept Fluency (CF), half-price promotions can greatly increase the impact of FGCS and FGCH on GPI. This research (1) contributes to the body of knowledge already available on social media UGC versus FGC, and (2) illustrates how social media content type and provider affect consumers' intentions to make green purchases, and (3) illustrates the influence of branded content and promotional strategies on university student consumers. Overall, this study enables businesses to better understand how forms of green content marketing and promotional models can engage university students’ consumers in social media interactions and generate green purchase intentions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Engagement; Firm-generated Content; Green Purchase Intentions; Humour; Promotions; Storytelling; User-generated Content,,,,,"Zhu, Peng, A novel discrete conformable fractional grey system model for forecasting carbon dioxide emissions, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 27, 6, pp. 13581-13609, (2025); Okbagaber, Tadesse Beyene, Determining the effects of government's perceived ecological roles on Chinese consumers' proenvironmental attitude, and green consumerism: The moderating effect of greenwashing perceptions, Journal of Public Affairs, 23, 1, (2023); Huang, Han, Why don't more people engage in green practices in China?

To address this gap, we focus on the role of humor and examine how and when employee humor can mitigate customer mistreatment. By integrating affective event theory and social exchange theory, we propose that employee humor can reduce customer mistreatment by increasing customer positive affect. Moreover, the influence of employee humor on customer positive affect as well as the indirect influence of employee humor on customer mistreatment through customer positive affect are particularly pronounced among female customers compared with male customers. We find support for our predictions in a field study (Study 1) and a scenario experiment (Study 2).

This research examined the effects of two humor styles (self-enhancing vs. self-deprecating) on customers’ intentions to continue using imperfect service robots along with boundary conditions and underlying mechanisms. Three scenario-based experiments were conducted to test the proposed relationships. The results revealed that self-enhancing humor led to stronger continued usage intentions compared to self-deprecating humor, particularly in standardized service settings and luxury hotels. This effect was driven by higher perceptions of playfulness and expertise.

A 3 (mascot type: none, static, animated) × 2 (team identification: high, low) between-subjects experiment was conducted with 203 participants recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our findings show that the presence of mascots significantly impacts consumer evaluations, with social presence and engagement acting as sequential mediators.

As a counterpoint, we argue that theory from the humanities, especially theatre and drama studies, can provide meaningful insights into consumer culture. Inspired by the Theatre of the Absurd, we develop four absurd prompts present in consumer culture: menace, aphasia, parody, and frustration. Taken together, these prompts amount to an absurd condition, a hall of mirrors, in which consumers inevitably find themselves. While the market promises different ways out of this condition, through manners, speech, sincerity, and attainment, we argue that these promises remain empty, amounting only to absurd inversions leading to new halls of mirrors.

This study aims to propose and empirically test a model to elucidate the various factors that influence followers' perceptions of manipulative intent. The study analyzed data from 188 participants using structural equation modeling, and the findings indicated that only two variables were effective in managing the perception of manipulation. These include the sense of gratitude and the balance between commercial and non-commercial contents.

However, how audio features in advertisements impact viewers' behavior remains unexplored. Design/methodology/approach: Using the lens of signaling theory, this research uses advanced data analytics of voice and music audio in Super Bowl advertisements to examine its impacts on viewers. Findings: Results show that advertisement viewers prefer more voiced frames and have a greater liking behavior of voiced frames with a low intensity (less loud) and a higher F1 frequency, which is typically associated with male vocal tracts. A fast music tempo works better for longer advertisements. The model controls for various types of ad appeals. The research underlines the importance of voice and music in signaling successful brand features that are likely to increase the ad-liking behavior of consumers (positive effect). Research limitations/implications: The current research implies that brands advertising through sports ads must carefully select voice actors and music in order to provide the most positive signals for a brand to have the most significant effect and, thus, a greater return on the high sums invested in the ads. Originality/value: First, this research contributes in terms of a new research process for using audio analytics in advertising. The detailed research process outlined can be used for future research examining audio and music from advertisements. Second, our findings provide additional support to the important role of voice features (e.g. intensity and frequency) as signals in inducing responses from consumers (Biswas et al., 2019; Hagtvedt and Brasel, 2016).

How to mitigate the negative impact of AI agent failures and improve customer forgiveness is imperative. In this study, we construct a model of the influence mechanism of affiliative and self-defeating humor types on customer forgiveness. Through four experimental studies (N = 1919), we find that AI agents expressing humor can effectively enhance customer forgiveness during service failures, with self-defeating humor having the best effect. Moreover, affiliative and self-defeating humor types can improve customers’ positive emotion and allow them to experience relief. The positive impact of AI agents expressing humor persisted in the low-severity failure condition but disappeared in the medium- and high-severity conditions. These findings extend the existing literature on AI agents expressing humor and guide online service providers to mitigate and minimize the negative effects of AI agents’ service failures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Affiliative Humor; Conversational Artificial Intelligence Agents; Customer Forgiveness; Self-defeating Humor; Service Failure,,,,This work was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (grant number: 21AZD116).,"Agnihotri, Arpita, Chatbots’ effectiveness in service recovery, International Journal of Information Management, 76, (2024); Ali, Faizan, Would you forgive me?

This research aims to develop such a system, providing actionable insights to guide the enhancement of the aesthetic experience of city outdoor advertising. To this end, we identified the factors affecting the aesthetic perception of outdoor advertising in cities through literature, interviews, and questionnaires. We then explored the commonalities and differences in perception judgments between residents and tourists, as well as their priorities for improving the aesthetic perception of city outdoor advertising, using the Kano model and the two-dimensional quadrant analysis of the Satisfaction Increment Index (SII) - Dissatisfaction Decrement Index (DDI). The result reveals that residents and tourists hold distinct perceptions regarding “clear and understandable information” and “offer multilingual support” However, there is a consensus between the two groups on other factors influencing aesthetic perception. Additionally, the research highlights disparities in their priorities for improvement. For residents, “clear and understandable information,” “engaging and entertaining,” “cultural adaptability,” “environmental adaptability,” and “provide social service information” are of greater importance. In contrast, tourists place a higher value on “rapid responsiveness.” These findings provide theoretical support and practical guidance for urban planners and outdoor advertising designers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Aesthetic Perception; City Image; Kano Model; Outdoor Advertising; Visual Design; Adult; Advertising; City; Decision Making; Esthetics; Female; Human; Male; Questionnaire; Adult; Advertising; Cities; Esthetics; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Surveys And Questionnaires,adult; advertising; city; decision making; esthetics; female; human; male; questionnaire; Adult; Advertising; Cities; Esthetics; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Surveys and Questionnaires,,,"Funding text 1: This research was supported by Major Program of National Social Science Fund of Arts of China (grant number 22ZD18); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (grant number KYCX24_2494).; Funding text 2: This research was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (grant number KYCX24_2494 ); National Social Science Fund (grant number 22ZD18 ).","Alhitmi, Hitmi Khalifa, Data security and privacy concerns of AI-driven marketing in the context of economics and business field: an exploration into possible solutions, Cogent Business and Management, 11, 1, (2024); Al-Qenaie, Shamlan D., Mapping sounds in the commercial linguistic landscape of Kuwait: A workable solution, Ampersand, 10, (2023); Marketing Science, (1993); Azumah, Dogbeda Mawulolo Yao, Visual Pollution Through Excessive Outdoor Advertisements, Palgrave Studies of Marketing in Emerging Economies, Part F3548, pp. 193-228, (2021); Kanos Methods for Understanding Customer Defined Quality, (1993); Bernard, Shaniel, Breaking barriers for Bangladeshi female solo travelers, Tourism Management Perspectives, 41, (2022); Bibri, Simon Elias, Data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future: An evidence synthesis approach to a comprehensive state-of-the-art literature review, Sustainable Futures, 3, (2021); Borowiak, Klaudia, Urban visual pollution: comparison of two ways of evaluation—a case study from Europe, Scientific Reports, 14, 1, (2024); Borsatto, Jaluza Maria Lima Silva, Green innovation and environmental regulations: a systematic review of international academic works, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 28, 45, pp. 63751-63768, (2021); Campbell, Colin L., Preparing for an Era of Deepfakes and AI-Generated Ads: A Framework for Understanding Responses to Manipulated Advertising, Journal of Advertising, 51, 1, pp. 22-38, (2022)",,Elsevier B.V.,,,,,,00016918; 18736297,,APSOA,39985834,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85218758973

A key strategy for success is to enhance user favorability and adoption. However, whether users prefer a human or an AI in the role of educator remains an important yet underexplored question. This research conducted three behavioral studies to examine user behavior toward AI-powered educational tools versus human educators, focusing on users' intentions to use these tools and their word-of-mouth (WOM) recommendations. Our findings show that users are more inclined to prefer human educators for their children and are more likely to share this preference with others (Studies 1 and 2). The underlying reason is that users perceive human educators as more capable than AI tools (Study 2). Study 3 further reveals that the type of problem-solving moderates the effect of the educational approach on both intentions to use and WOM. Specifically, users believe that AI tools are better suited for conventional problem-solving, while human educators are preferred for creative problem-solving. Our research is the first to investigate users' adoption of AI educational tools compared to human educators and the underlying mechanism. AI educational tool providers are advised to address users' negative perceptions and alleviate their concerns by demonstrating the competence of AI tools or by actively engaging with users to foster their competence in AI's capabilities. These novel insights contribute to the rapidly growing field of AI research and offer valuable implications for AI educational tools seeking success in the marketplace. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ai Educational Tool; Human Educator; Problem-solving; User Behavior; Word-of-mouth; Ai Educational Tool; Education Market; Educational Tools; Human Educator; Human Touches; Intention To Use; Problem-solving; Tool Companies; User Behaviors; User's Preferences; Article; Child; Education; Human; Problem Solving; Touch,AI educational tool; Education market; Educational tools; Human educator; Human touches; Intention to use; Problem-solving; Tool companies; User behaviors; User's preferences; article; child; education; human; problem solving; touch,,,"Funding text 1: We conducted a one-factor (educational approach: human educator vs. AI educational tool) ANCOVA on intention to use and WOM. The results showed that compared to AI educational tools, parents were more willing to use human educators to educate their children and significantly spread this educational approach more to friends and other parents, supporting H1 (Table 3).The mediating role of competence. To examine the mediating effect of competence on the relationship between educational approach and intention to use as well as WOM, we utilized Hayes's (2022) bootstrapping procedures (Model 4, 5000 bootstrap samples, 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals [CI]) with the educational approach serving as the independent variable (X, human educators = 1, AI tools = 2), competence as the mediator (M), and intention to use as well as WOM as the dependent variables (Y). The results showed that competence mediated the relationship between educational approach and intention to use as well as WOM, which, to a certain extent, revealed the reason why participants were more likely to tutor their children by human educators and share more about their educating approach to employing human educators than using AI educational tools, thus support H2 (Table 4). Secondly, our findings revealed that these negative behaviors stem from users' belief that human educators are more competent than AI educational tools. Therefore, AI educational tools managers can alleviate these user concerns by showcasing the competence of AI educational tools, thereby augmenting their intention to use and generating positive WOM. This nuanced understanding of user behaviors can empower managers to effectively enhance users\u2019 intention to use AI tools and positive WOM, ultimately improving the survival rate of AI educational tools providers. For instance, Amira highlights a third party sponsored research by Columbia University (2021), demonstrating that students who used Amira AI reading assistant experienced literacy learning gains on par with human tutoring programs.AI educational tools are booming in the marketplace with incredible potential for the AI-in-Education industry and future human-AI interactions for all. These products are transforming the way we learn and reshaping the educational landscape in numerous ways, poised to bring tremendous benefits to students with far-reaching consequences for society at large. While current AI educational tools focus on providing competent support to students, can they go further and incorporate a sense of warmth in their interactions with students? For example, increasing emotional communication and interaction with users can help enhance their learning attention and perseverance. However, it is necessary to remain vigilant to ensure that the advancement of these technologies does not impair users\u2019 interactions with other humans or trap them in AI environments from which they cannot withdraw. This question warrants deeper investigation in future studies.Third, this research focuses on how parent users choose human educators or AI educational tools to tutor their children in the family education environment. Previous studies have shown that AI provides teachers with innovative tools and methods to enhance teaching quality (Grubaugh & Levitt, 2023). AI also supports students with special needs, generates feedback, personalizes learning, and reduces dropout rates (Mikeladze et al., 2024). In the future, it will be rewarding to explore how other education stakeholders, such as students and teachers, utilize AI educational tools.This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 71972130 and Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (435-2023-0306).

Here, we investigate whether offensive ads, when shown to search engine users, have such effects. We developed 12 search scenarios and created 4 versions of the search results page (SERP) for each scenario, where some of the ads were changed to be irrelevant and/or offensive. Crowdsourced judges found a strong correlation (≥ 0.63) between the reported number of annoying ads and the actual number of offensive and irrelevant ads, suggesting people conflate these attributes. Furthermore, we found that judges who assessed the SERPs for themselves reported lower positive affect and higher negative affect than judges asked to imagine the results were provided to someone else. In the latter case offensive ads also lead to slightly lower positive (−4%) and higher negative affect (+61%). Finally, in a recall test, only 6% of judges reported seeing an offensive ad when using search engines. Our work should further detract advertisers from using offensive ads since, in addition to previously documented adverse effects, such ads have a small but statistically significant negative effect on people’s emotional experience. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Search Advertising; Search Engines; Adverse Effect; Advertizers; Advertizing; Emotional Experiences; Negative Affects; Positive Affects; Search Advertizing; Strong Correlation; Search Engines,Adverse effect; Advertizers; Advertizing; Emotional experiences; Negative affects; Positive affects; Search advertizing; Strong correlation; Search engines,,,,"Statista Global no 1 Business Data Platform, (2019); Journal of Marketing, (1985); Aliyeva, Nazrin, Which is More Shocking: Investigation of Improper and Morally Offensive Communication, Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies, 205, pp. 325-335, (2021); Barnes, James H., An exploratory investigation into the nature of offensive television advertising, Journal of Advertising, 19, 3, pp. 61-69, (1990); Boddewyn, Jean J., Sex and decency issues in advertising: General and international dimensions, Business Horizons, 34, 5, pp. 13-20, (1991); Burke, Moira K., High-cost banner blindness: Ads increase perceived workload, hinder visual search, and are forgotten, ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, 12, 4, pp. 423-445, (2005); Buscher, Georg, The good, the bad, and the random: An eye-tracking study of ad quality in web search, pp. 42-49, (2010); Synthesis Lectures on Information Concepts Retrieval and Services, (2010); Chan, Kara K.W., Consumers' response to offensive advertising: A cross cultural study, International Marketing Review, 24, 5, pp. 606-628, (2007); Christy, Timothy P., The influence of advertising context on perceptions of offense, Journal of Marketing Communications, 14, 4, pp. 271-291, (2008)",,Association for Computing Machinery,,,,,,10468188; 15582868,,ATISE,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105005605958

It not only allows for immediate feedback but also builds a sense of trust and connection between streamers and consumers. Drawing on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), we investigate how central and peripheral route factors affect consumers’ trust building and purchase intentions. Additionally, we identify consumer involvement as a key moderator affecting the relationship between central route factors and trust in product as well as the relationship between peripheral route factors and trust in streamer. Design/methodology/approach: To test the research model, we collected data from 423 consumers on TaoBao Live. Findings: The findings show that information completeness, accuracy and currency positively affect trust in the product, while perceived physical characteristic similarity, streamer humor attractiveness and passion attractiveness positively affect trust in the streamer. Trust in the streamer positively influences trust in the product, which subsequently impacts purchase intention. Moreover, involvement moderates the effects of information accuracy, currency, perceived physical characteristic similarity and passion attractiveness on trust. Originality/value: First, we examine the direct influence of product- and streamer-related cues on consumer trust and purchase intention through distinct pathways. Second, we adopt ELM to explain the process of consumer trust building by investigating how central and peripheral route factors influence purchase intention through consumer trust in live streaming settings. Third, we incorporate involvement as a crucial moderator, shedding light on the boundary conditions of trust building in live streaming e-commerce. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Consumer Trust; Elaboration Likelihood Model; Involvement; Live Streaming E-commerce; Building Information Model; Marketplaces; Sales; Video Streaming; Consumer Trust; E- Commerces; Elaboration Likelihood Models; Involvement; Live Streaming; Live Streaming E-commerce; Physical Characteristics; Purchase Intention; Real Time Videos; Trust Building; Moderators,Building Information Model; Marketplaces; Sales; Video streaming; Consumer trust; E- commerces; Elaboration likelihood models; Involvement; Live streaming; Live streaming e-commerce; Physical characteristics; Purchase intention; Real time videos; Trust building; Moderators,,,"This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72271072 and 72071190), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (JZ2024HGTG0314 and JZ2023HGPA0294).","Multiple Regression Testing and Interpreting Interactions, (1991); Bezençon, Valéry, Ethical products and consumer involvement: What's new?, European Journal of Marketing, 44, 9, pp. 1305-1321, (2010); Bhattacherjee, Anol, Influence processes for information technology acceptance: An elaboration likelihood model, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 30, 4, pp. 805-825, (2006); Bian, Xuemei, The role of brand image, product involvement, and knowledge in explaining consumer purchase behaviour of counterfeits: Direct and indirect effects, European Journal of Marketing, 45, 1, pp. 191-216, (2011); Advances in Consumer Research, (1982); Cardon, Melissa S., Is passion contagious?

Built on the justice theory, this paper aims to explore the optimal way to utilize chatbots in handling customer complaints for service failure recovery and the moderating role of humor. Design/methodology/approach: Two scenario-based between-subjects experimental design studies were conducted to examine the two aspects of justice in service failure recovery: Study 1 focuses on procedural justice manifested as perceived control and Study 2 on interactional justice assessed as social presence. Furthermore, the moderating role of humor is investigated. Findings: The results indicate that both perceived control and social presence can improve chatbots’ effectiveness in handling service failures to regain customer satisfaction and the consequent revisit intention. However, humor shows opposite effects in the two studies: chatbots using humorous language in complaint handling may attenuate the positive effect of perceived control but enhance the positive effect of social presence. Practical implications: The findings provide practical guidelines to the service industry regarding the optimal service design and technology deployment in customer service, particularly for an effective service failure recovery process. Originality/value: This research contributes to the service failure recovery literature by investigating how the new service technology of AI-powered chatbots can effectively handle customer complaints for service failure recovery.

Humor, as an influential way of information expression, is frequently used in ads to elicit emotions. Drawing upon literature on advertisement humor and new product purchase intention and the theory of planned behavior, the study proposes that humor stimulation in advertisements can affect consumers' new product purchase intentions, in which two process mechanisms, namely, emotional arousal and cognitive flexibility, play a mediating effect. Design/methodology/approach: To test the assertions, the authors conduct three experimental studies. The authors' first study assesses the main effect between advertisement humor and purchase intentions. In the second study, the authors show the mediating effects of emotional pleasure, emotional arousal, and cognitive flexibility on the relationship between advertisement humor and purchase intentions. In the first two experiments, the authors study incremental new products. In the third study, the authors study the same mediating relationships for radically new products. Findings: This study's results show consumers that watch humorous ads are more likely to choose new products than those who watch non-humorous ads (Study 1); compared with non-humorous ads, humorous ads can enhance emotional arousal, thus promoting cognitive flexibility and making consumers more inclined to choose new products (Study 2 and Study 3). That said, the authors find that these mediation effects are only partial. Originality/value: This study's results have important implications for firms vying to enhance consumers' new product purchase intentions by deploying humorous ads. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Cognitive Flexibility; Emotional Arousal; Humor; New Product Purchase Intention,,,,,"Aboulnasr, Khaled, Is love really blind?

This study adopts a thematic review approach, employing a systematic literature review methodology (e.g., Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses [PRISMA] protocol). Our investigation unearthed 155 articles from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, spanning 2010–2023. The findings reveal a marked increase in EEG-related research, underscoring its effectiveness in examining consumers' reactions to marketing stimuli. This rise reflects a growing recognition among researchers of EEG's ability to address marketing research challenges, particularly in advertising, product development, branding, and pricing. EEG research predominantly targets advertising, followed by products, branding, and pricing, and delves deeply into consumer behavior aspects such as emotional, cognitive, and decision-making processes. The study further highlights EEG's cutting-edge potential to predict ad success, optimize product features, and refine pricing strategies with unprecedented accuracy. Specifically, emotion-based ads profoundly influence decision-making, offering novel insights into consumers' emotional engagement. This study emphasizes EEG's groundbreaking role in minimizing verbal biases and revealing consumer behavior, which is increasingly recognized as critical for developing more effective marketing strategies. This review underscores EEG's theoretical and practical contributions and offers pioneering insights into marketing effectiveness and consumer engagement. Future research should expand on these findings, exploring product neurodesign and social neuroscience to push the frontiers of consumer behavior analysis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Consumer Behavior; Electroencephalography; Marketing Stimuli; Neuromarketing; Scopus Database; Wos Database,,,,Funding: The authors received no specific funding for this work.

Companies, in the past, have used different tools to grab their customers’ attention and encourage them to buy their products. The purpose of this research is to introduce strategic self-anticonformity (SSA) as an effective tool in the advertising industry. This study demonstrates that SSA relates positively to attention, and ultimately to purchase intention. An experiment was conducted to manipulate the SSA condition. The study also shows that product involvement moderates the relationship between SSA and attention. In addition, attitude toward ad mediates the relationship between attention and purchase intention. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Advertising; Advertising Effectiveness; Attention; Purchase Intention; Strategic Self-anticonformity,,,,,"Ad of the Day Patagonia, (2011); Akbari, Mahsa, Different Impacts of Advertising Appeals on Advertising Attitude for High and Low Involvement Products, Global Business Review, 16, 3, pp. 478-493, (2015); Allan, David, Effects of popular music in advertising on attention and memory, Journal of Advertising Research, 46, 4, pp. 434-444, (2006); Behe, Bridget K., The effect of involvement on visual attention and product choice, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 24, C, pp. 10-21, (2015); Behe, Bridget K., Display signs and involvement: The visual path to purchase intention, International Review of Retail, Distribution and Consumer Research, 23, 5, pp. 511-522, (2013); Berger, Jonah A., What makes online content viral?, Journal of Marketing Research, 49, 2, pp. 192-205, (2012); Lady Gagas Applause Hits no 1 on Dance Chart, (2013); Psychological Reactance A Theory of Freedom and Control, (1981); Buhrmester, Michael D., Amazon's mechanical Turk: A new source of inexpensive, yet high-quality, data?, Perspectives on Psychological Science, 6, 1, pp. 3-5, (2011); Chaiken, Shelly, Heuristic versus systematic information processing and the use of source versus message cues in persuasion, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 39, 5, pp. 752-766, (1980)",,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,,,,,,21639159; 21639167,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85207284607

While the concept is valuable in assessing consumers’ appreciation of advertising, the findings regarding its antecedents and consequences have been inconclusive in past research. To help understand the potential role of advertising value in the assessment of advertising effects, the current study constructs an advertising value framework and adopts a meta-analytic approach to assess its antecedents’ predictive power, verify its potential mediating role on consequences, and elaborate on the moderating roles of advertising type and national culture. By reviewing and analyzing 98 papers with 107 studies (N = 44,706), this meta-analytic study found that credibility, entertainment, and informativeness were the top three influential antecedents of advertising value, which were followed by irritation and relevance. Moreover, the correlation patterns of the advertising value framework were different across advertising types and Hofstede’s culture dimensions. Our findings clarify the antecedents and consequences of advertising value, emphasize the significance of incorporating advertising value to assess advertising effects, and explain the current research discrepancies, which contribute to theoretical advancements of advertising value and provide practical guidelines for advertisers in advertising design. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,"This work was supported by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Xiamen University (20720231026), The Social Science Fund Project of Fujian Province (FJ2023BF070, FJ2023C032).","Abbasi, Amir Zaib, The impact of advertising value of in-game pop-up ads in online gaming on gamers’ inspiration: An empirical investigation, Telematics and Informatics, 62, (2021); Ajzen, Icek, The theory of planned behavior, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); An, Daechun, A first investigation into the cross-cultural perceptions of internet advertising, Journal of International Consumer Marketing, 20, 2, pp. 49-65, (2008); Arli, Denni I., Does Social Media Matter?

Brand managers must decide what and how to communicate effectively and cost-efficiently. Social networks provide an economical avenue for direct consumer engagement, especially among younger demographics. The growing prominence of video content on platforms like TikTok and YouTube highlights the need for carefully crafted social media video strategies. This study explores the impact of humanized and humor-based content on consumer perception metrics, such as brand personality, authenticity, leadership, and equity. It also examines generational and gender-based differences in these perceptions. Methodologically, it analyzes case studies of social media videos from Swee and Lidl, contrasting humanized and humorous content with rational, less humanized approaches. Data were collected from a sample of 122 respondents through a questionnaire, assessing their perceptions of the brands' social media content. Statistical techniques, including descriptive analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and chi-square tests, were employed to analyze brand perception differences across content types. Results reveal that humanized and humorous content outperforms rational content in enhancing brand personality, authenticity, leadership, and equity for both brands. The findings underline the importance of humanization and humor in social media strategies, especially for improving consumer engagement and perception. Implications for academic research, brand management practices, and future studies are also discussed, emphasizing the value of these approaches in contemporary digital marketing. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Brand Equity; Brand Metrics; Humanized Content; Humor; Social Media Videos; Information Systems; Marketing; Multimedia Systems; Social Networking (online); Statistical Tests; Video Analysis; Brand Equity; Brand Managers; Brand Metric; Humanized Content; Humor; Social Media; Social Medium Video; Video Contents; Video Strategy; Youtube; Analysis Of Variance (anova),Information systems; Marketing; Multimedia systems; Social networking (online); Statistical tests; Video analysis; Brand equity; Brand managers; Brand metric; Humanized content; Humor; Social media; Social medium video; Video contents; Video strategy; YouTube; Analysis of variance (ANOVA),,,"This work is financed by Portuguese national funds through FCT - Funda\u00E7\u00E3o para a Ci\u00EAncia e Tecnologia, under the project UIDB/05422/2020.

Drawing on van Leeuwen’s concept of “integrated design” and social semiotic approaches to multimodal analysis, this study investigates how metaphorical ambiguity is used to facilitate behavioral change through abductive reasoning. The analysis reveals that strategic ambiguity functions not as a communicative barrier, but rather as a semiotic resource that invites active meaning-making within specific sociocultural contexts. The findings demonstrate that effective behavioral change campaigns benefit from metaphors that transcend conventional associations through calculated semantic tension. This research contributes to the existing literature on advertising metaphors and practical campaign design in sustainability advertising discourse by showcasing how strategic ambiguity can enhance campaign effectiveness through the integration of multimodal semiotic resources. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Advertising; Ambiguity; Integrated Design; Metaphor; Sustainability,,,,,"Uk Advertising Launches Ad Net Zero, (2020); Arrighi, Claudia, Abductive reasoning, interpretation and collaborative processes, Foundations of Science, 13, 1, pp. 75-87, (2008); Attardo, Salvatore, Humorous metaphors, 26, pp. 91-110, (2015); Bateman, John A., Addressing methodological challenges in brand communications research: A comparison of structuralist, peircean and social semiotic readings of advertising, International Journal of Marketing Semiotics and Discourse Studies, 4, pp. 237-279, (2016); Handbook of Visual Analysis, (2001); Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, (1954); Clarke, Bowman L., The argument from design-A piece of abductive reasoning, International Journal for Philosophy of Religion, 5, 2, pp. 65-78, (1974); Signs, (2010); Cobley, Paul, Human understanding: The key triad, American Journal of Semiotics, 34, 1-2, pp. 17-38, (2018); Dehay, Eliza K., A MAP for effective advertising: the metaphoric advertising processing model, AMS Review, 9, 3-4, pp. 289-303, (2019)",,University of Kassel,,,,,,21952280,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-105010214613

Yet, its prominent role in content creation remains often undisclosed due to potential aversive consumer reactions. In three studies, we examined how advertisers can transparently disclose AI authorship in ads without compromising marketing effectiveness. Study 1 was a proof-of-concept study, revealing that humor could alleviate negative evaluations (when the joke was less funny, AI received more negative ratings than a human author; however, when the joke was funnier, AI received similar ratings to a human author). Study 2 incorporated jokes into disclosures about AI authorship in advertising and found that humor reduced the negative effect of AI authorship because it shortened the psychological distance toward AI, positively impacting purchase intentions. Study 3 replicated these effects and tested a boundary condition, showing that humor mitigated algorithm aversion only when it was sufficiently funny. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ai-generated Content; Digital Advertising; Disclosures; Humor; Psychological Distance; Advertizers; Artificial Intelligence-generated Content; Concept Studies; Content Creation; Digital Advertizing; Disclosure; Humor; Online Advertisements; Proof Of Concept; Psychological Distance; Sales,Advertizers; Artificial intelligence-generated content; Concept studies; Content creation; Digital advertizing; Disclosure; Humor; Online advertisements; Proof of concept; Psychological distance; Sales,,,"The research presented in this paper was financially supported by the National Science Centre in Poland.

Our findings indicate that mirth mediated the effects of the humor types on publics’ perceptions that the scientist on social media was communicating information in an appropriate and legitimate way. Overall, this suggests that scientists can elicit mirth by using combining satire and anthropomorphic humor, which can enhance publics’ perceptions of scientists. Importantly, publics’ responses to harsh satire were not examined. Caution should be exercised when using satire due to potential backfire effects. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Digital Science Communication; Public Engagement With Science And Technology; Public Perception Of Science; Technology,,,,"Funding statement.

An advertisement’s persuasiveness is determined by its ability to engage consumers, which is the underlying concept. Despite a wide variety of theoretical and empirical literature available in the field of advertisement engagement, mapping the knowledge structure of advertisement engagement literature remains relatively less undertaken. Methodology: The goal of this study was to map the literature on advertisement engagement by performing a bibliometric and network analysis in light of this gap. In order to map the body of knowledge on advertisement engagement, this study examined significant journals, yearly publications, ground-breaking writers, and significant papers published between 2000 and 2024. Findings: The findings of the study suggested that the USA is the most contributing country, and the International Journal for Advertising published a maximum number of studies in the field of advertising engagement. Furthermore, Yang et al.’s (2021) research made the most contribution to the field of advertisement engagement on social media platforms of all researchers. Practical Implications: The study mapped how participation in advertisements affected the surrounding environment. Originality Value: It has been discovered that more research is being done in the area of advertising engagement due to the growing popularity of more recent media. This study provides a framework for future research on advertisement engagement while mapping the literature and trends in the field. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Advertisement Engagement; Advertisement Involvement; Bibliometric Analysis; Network Analysis,,,,,"Agrawal, Shivani, Anthropomorphism in advertising: the effect of media on audience attitude, Journal of Marketing Communications, 27, 8, pp. 799-815, (2021); Ahuja, Deeksha, Fifty Years of Research on Vedas: A Bibliometric Analysis, Prabandhan: Indian Journal of Management, 15, 8, pp. 59-72, (2022); Akarsu, Haluk, Engagement publicitario: conceptualización, desarrollo de escala y validación, Fonseca Journal of Communication, 26, pp. 283-301, (2023); Broadus, Robert N., Toward a definition of ""bibliometrics, Scientometrics, 12, 5-6, pp. 373-379, (1987); Burton, Bruce Bruce, Twenty-five years of The European Journal of Finance (EJF): a retrospective analysis, European Journal of Finance, 26, 18, pp. 1817-1841, (2020); Calder, Bobby J., Media Engagement and Advertising Effectiveness, pp. 1-36, (2015); Calder, Bobby J., An Experimental Study of the Relationship between Online Engagement and Advertising Effectiveness, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 23, 4, pp. 321-331, (2009); Calder, Bobby J., How to capture consumer experiences: A context-specific approach to measuring engagement: Predicting consumer behavior across qualitatively different experiences, Journal of Advertising Research, 56, 1, pp. 39-52, (2016); Callon, Michel, From translations to problematic networks: An introduction to co-word analysis, Social Science Information, 22, 2, pp. 191-235, (1983); Journal of Electronic Commerce Research, (2008)",,Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

The emergence of digital human characters in e-commerce livestreaming, also known as virtual streamers, raises the question: Can social-oriented language used by virtual streamers increase the customers' purchase intention? However, the theoretical understanding of whether, how, and when the interaction effect between virtual streamers' social-oriented language and product type influences purchase intention remains far from conclusive. Based on the stereotype content model (SCM), we developed a theoretical model to explain the mechanism between virtual streamers' linguistic style and customers’ purchase intention. A multi-method study combining two online experiments, one lab experiment, and one focus group was conducted to explore the effectiveness of social-oriented language (Study 1: N = 321; Study 2: N = 292; Study 3: N = 120; Study 4: N = 9). Participants in both Study 1 and Study 2 were recruited online and were randomly assigned to a condition in 2 (linguistic style: social-oriented vs. task-oriented) × 2 (product type: experience vs. search) between-subjects experimental design. Participants were recruited in the university by three blind-to-hypothesis experimenters in Study 3 and were randomly assigned to a condition in 2 (linguistic style: social-oriented vs. task-oriented) × 2 (product type: experience vs. search) × 2 (virtual streamer type: human-like vs. animated) between-subjects experimental design in the behavioral lab. Participants in Study 4 were recruited from a large WeChat group specifically interested in online shopping discounts. The results of Study 1 indicate the effect of social-oriented language on purchase intention solely in the experience product condition. Study 2 demonstrates the mediating role of perceived warmth and perceived competence, and confirms a compensatory effect and a positive relationship between perceived warmth and competence. Study 3 verifies the moderating role of the virtual streamer type while a focus group Study 4 supports the findings from Studies 1–3. Our findings extend the livestreaming commerce literature by exploring the implications of social-oriented language and task-oriented language when the live streamer is a digital human rather than a human. Also, we provide fresh insights into the literature on human-AI interactions by unraveling both the cognitive mechanism and the boundary condition, deepening our understanding of a novel but under-investigated phenomenon. Furthermore, our findings provide practical implications for livestreaming commerce practitioners. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Linguistic Style; Livestreaming Commerce; Purchase Intention; Stereotype Content Model; Virtual Streamers; Consumption Behavior; Electronic Commerce; Language; Marketing; Shopping Activity; Social Network,consumption behavior; electronic commerce; language; marketing; shopping activity; social network,,,This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71904106 and No. 72072103) and the National Social Science Fund of China (Grant No. 23BTQ086).,"Aaker, Jennifer Lynn, Nonprofits are seen as warm and for-profits as competent: Firm stereotypes matter, Journal of Consumer Research, 37, 2, pp. 224-237, (2010); Angmo, Padma, Virtual influencer marketing: a study of millennials and gen Z consumer behaviour, Qualitative Market Research, 27, 2, pp. 280-300, (2024); Baron, Reuben M., The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research.

However, the research on emotional expression by chatbots is still in its infancy, and the existing research on this aspect is inconclusive. Therefore, from the perspective of chatbots expressing humor, this study proposes a boundary condition for the effectiveness of chatbot-expressed humor and a different influence mechanism of expressing humor in different dialogues on service satisfaction through four experimental studies. Our study found that chatbots' expression of humor in chit-chat dialogues leads to higher perceived entertainment and service satisfaction for customers; however, chatbots' expression of humor in task-oriented dialogues leads to distraction and lower service satisfaction. In addition, we found that entertainment significantly mediated between humor in chit-chat dialogues and service satisfaction, while distraction had a significant indirect effect between humor in task-oriented dialogues and service satisfaction. These findings deepen our understanding of chatbot-expressed humor and provide valuable insights into online retailers’ deployment of humorous chatbots. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Chatbot-expressed Humor; Chit-chat Dialogue; Distraction; Entertainment; Service Satisfaction; Task-oriented Dialogue; Customer Satisfaction; Artificial Intelligence Technologies; Chatbot-expressed Humor; Chatbots; Chit-chat Dialog; Distraction; Influence Mechanism; Online Customers; Service Satisfaction; Task-oriented; Task-oriented Dialog; Sales,Customer satisfaction; Artificial intelligence technologies; Chatbot-expressed humor; Chatbots; Chit-chat dialog; Distraction; Influence mechanism; Online customers; Service satisfaction; Task-oriented; Task-oriented dialog; Sales,,,This study is funded by the National Social Science Fund of China (grant number: 21AZD116 ).,"Ashfaq, Muhammad, I, Chatbot: Modeling the determinants of users’ satisfaction and continuance intention of AI-powered service agents, Telematics and Informatics, 54, (2020); Ayres, Paul L., Something old, something new from cognitive load theory, Computers in Human Behavior, 113, (2020); Benlian, Alexander, Mitigating the intrusive effects of smart home assistants by using anthropomorphic design features: A multimethod investigation, Information Systems Journal, 30, 6, pp. 1010-1042, (2020); Brendel, Alfred Benedikt, The Paradoxical Role of Humanness in Aggression Toward Conversational Agents, Journal of Management Information Systems, 40, 3, pp. 883-913, (2023); Chan Fong Yee, Fanny, Placing products in humorous scenes: its impact on brand perceptions, European Journal of Marketing, 55, 3, pp. 649-670, (2021); Chen, Jashen, Usability and responsiveness of artificial intelligence chatbot on online customer experience in e-retailing, International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, 49, 11, pp. 1512-1531, (2021); Chen, Chia Chen, What drives live-stream usage intention?

As the number of Instagram users rises, businesses are advised to use eminent marketing tools and effectively engage with customers on the platform. Creating a strong brand image in consumers’ minds should be one of the main objectives of advertising. To be able to catch the attention of consumers, advertising appeal may be achieved through innovation and advertising creativity. This study examines the role of advertising appeal of social media marketing on consumer attention and purchase intention. Employing the qualitative thematic data analysis, six informants were intensively interviewed. All data was transcribed and analysed using the NVivo 12 software. The results indicate that advertising appeals effectively capture customer attention and stimulate their needs, wants, and interests in purchasing a product or service. Additionally, these appeals facilitate clear communication of messages that customers can easily understand and respond to, thereby influencing consumer purchase intentions. The implications underscore the crucial role of advertising appeal in social media marketing and promotion, highlighting its impact on consumer behaviour and purchase decisions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Advertising Appeal; Consumer Attention; Promotion; Purchase Intention; Social Media Marketing,,,,,"Agil, Hamimda, The impact of social media advertising features on the purchase intention of the Malay millennial consumer, SEARCH Journal of Media and Communication Research, 14, 3, pp. 59-73, (2022); Test Engineering Management, (2020); Revista De Stiinte Politice, (2020); Internet Marketing Strategy Implementation and Practice, (2000); International Journal of Business and Management, (2020); Choi, Yung-kyun, Matching luxury brand appeals with attitude functions on social media across cultures, Journal of Business Research, 117, pp. 520-528, (2020); Millennials and the New Emotional Branding, (2021); Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design Choosing Among Five Traditions, (1998); DeJonckheere, Melissa J., Semistructured interviewing in primary care research: A balance of relationship and rigour, Family Medicine and Community Health, 7, 2, (2019); International Journal of Trend in Scientific Research and Development, (2019)",,Taylor's University Lakeside Campus,,,,,,26727080,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85204738597

Potentially, such humor could be included in viral public health campaigns to combat obesity, but would jokes actually increase the likelihood of purchasing healthy foods advertised on social media? 411 participants were asked to test two soon-to-be-introduced features (e.g., repost button) in Instagram on their phones. Participants scrolled through a series of posts about various topics ranging from architecture to beauty products. A healthy food post, preceded by one of four joke types (two containing the word “fat”), was embedded at the top, middle or bottom position of the Instagram page. After participants scrolled through the page, perhaps reposting some posts, they were presented with the healthy food product featured in the post and were asked to indicate a purchase probability (0–100), as well as whether they recognized the food product from the post (yes/no). At the end of the study, the individual jokes were rated as “funny/not funny” and “positive/negative”. If the food product was recognized, the joke type played a role. In particular, jokes containing the word “fat” had a negative effect on the purchase probability. However, if the food product was not recognized, only its position on the page mattered. The purchase probability was highest if the product was placed at the top. Social media, criticized for promoting unhealthy food consumption, especially among children, can therefore also be used to address issues such as the global obesity epidemic. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Healthy Food; Joke Content; Position; Purchase Intention; Social Media,,,,"The author(s) declare that fincancial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

The results of two studies showed that incongruity humor (vs. aggressive humor) induced greater social proximity between the source and the viewer, and humor type interacted with regulatory focus of a message to impact audience engagement. Specifically, incongruity humor paired with a prevention-focused message (vs. a promotion-focused message) resulted in greater content endorsement and health information engagement, whereas aggressive humor combined with a promotion-focused message (vs. a prevention-focused message) led to greater content endorsement. Results further identified processing fluency as a mediator of the fit effect on audience engagement.

As they become more proficient at understanding people's behaviors, preferences, intentions, and surroundings, opportunities for proactive interactions emerge. However, despite their potential benefits, people still find certain proactive agent interactions inappropriate and invasive, such as correcting or nudging the user. This study investigates humor's potential to enhance the desirability of proactive agent comments, given its stress-relieving and acceptance-promoting characteristics. We investigate how infusing humor into VA statements affects perceptions of appropriateness and desirability in proactive interventions. We designed storyboards showcasing voice assistants' proactive actions in everyday situations and social contexts. Participants () assessed these scenarios in an online questionnaire across multiple criteria. Our results reveal that humor's impact on proactive statement desirability is contingent on participants' perceptions of voice assistants and their subjective judgment of the humor. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Computational Humor; Conversational Agents; Home Assistants; Humor; Proactivity; Voice Assistants; Personal Digital Assistants; Complex Task; Computational Humor; Conversational Agents; Home Assistant; Humor; Language Processing; Natural Languages; People Behavior; Proactivity; Voice Assistant; Natural Language Processing Systems,Personal digital assistants; Complex task; Computational humor; Conversational agents; Home assistant; Humor; Language processing; Natural languages; People behavior; Proactivity; Voice assistant; Natural language processing systems,,,"We would like to sincerely thank Paweł W.

The review examines different forms of humor, including satire, stand-up comedy, and scripted entertainment programming, and their impact on audience responses. We also highlight the possible drawbacks of using humor and factors that moderate its effects. Overall, the evidence paints a mixed picture whereby pro-environmental humor is largely successful in influencing proximal cognitive outcomes (attention, perceptions) but has more limited influence on distal outcomes (behavior) with the greatest benefits seen among low-interest groups.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a between-subjects experimental design across two studies using new to the world online video advertisements as stimuli. Findings: Study 1 finds that increasing the intensity of sexual and violent humor improves advertisement effectiveness amongst men but leads to significantly more negative attitudes toward the advertisement and brand amongst women. Study 2 identifies gender and humor type as moderators for sharing intentions in the presence of audience diversity. While men are more likely to publicly share sexual and violent humor advertisements, social anxiety mediates intentions to share sexual humor advertisements in the presence of greater audience diversity. Practical implications: The paper offers insights to practitioners regarding the use of risqué forms of humor as part of a digital marketing strategy. Originality/value: Drawing on and extending benign violation theory, the paper introduces and verifies a theoretical model for understanding consumer responses to the use of risqué forms of humor in online advertisements.

However, what is considered humorous and what is not depends on many contextual and personal factors that are not only difficult for machines to detect, but even humans are still struggling to understand them. This makes training AI to be humorous highly challenging. But is this due only to the technical limitations? In this provocation paper, we discuss the hindrances to utilizing humor in commercial conversational agents and propose addressing this topic from a social and political perspective. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Computational Humor; Conversational Agents; Humor; Smart Speakers; Voice Assistants; Computational Humor; Conversational Agents; Human Likeness; Humor; Likeability; Smart Speaker; Technical Limitations; User Engagement; Users' Experiences; Voice Assistant,Computational humor; Conversational agents; Human likeness; Humor; Likeability; Smart speaker; Technical limitations; User engagement; Users' experiences; Voice assistant,,,"This work was partially funded by the Klaus Tschira Foundation, by the Leverhulme Trust (award DS-2017-026), by the FET-Open Project 951846 \u201CMUHAI \u2013 Meaning and Understanding for Human-centric AI\u201D funded by the EU program Horizon 2020, as well as the German Research Foundation DFG as part of Collaborative Research Center (Sonderforschungsbereich) 1320 \u201CEASE \u2013 Everyday Activity Science and Engineering\u201D, University of Bremen (http://www.ease-crc.org/).","Aho, Brett, Beyond surveillance capitalism: Privacy, regulation and big data in Europe and China, Economy and Society, 49, 2, pp. 187-212, (2020); Barral, Oswald, No need to laugh out loud: Predicting humor appraisal of comic strips based on physiological signals in a realistic environment, ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, 24, 6, (2017); Humor in the Advertising Business Theory Practice and Wit, (2008); Euroamerican Journal of Applied Linguistics and Languages, (2014); Bonfert, Michael, An Evaluation of Visual Embodiment for Voice Assistants on Smart Displays, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, (2021); Braslavski, Pavel I., How to evaluate humorous response generation, seriously?, 2018-March, pp. 225-228, (2018); Breazeal, Cynthia L., Toward sociable robots, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 42, 3-4, pp. 167-175, (2003); Brown, Tom B., Language models are few-shot learners, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020-December, (2020); Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence Early Experiments with Gpt 4, (2023); Buyya, Rajkumar, Fog and edge computing: Principles and paradigms, pp. 1-471, (2019)",,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",Bold Insight UK; Eindhoven AI Systems Institute (EAISI) TU/e; Eindhoven University of Technology TU/e; HMD Research; SIGCHI,"5th International Conference on Conversational User Interfaces, CUI 2023",,Eindhoven,190883,,9.80E+12,,,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85167783262

This shared attention in media-multitasking situations poses a challenge to media planers when attracting the audience's attention. However, attention-grabbing tactics might backfire on companies as they make manipulative intent salient and, therefore, decrease levels of brand attitude. This study advances the extant research by challenging the suitability of silence as an attention-grabbing practice in advertising during media multitasking. More specifically, we test if atypical (i.e. silent) slogans in TV commercials impact on consumers’ evaluation of brand-related information when media multitasking. Utilizing a one-factor (two-level) between-subject laboratory experiment (N = 66), this study examined participants’ feelings of manipulation and brand attitude when exposed to typical versus atypical TV advertising slogans in a media-multitasking situation. The results demonstrate that a typical TV advertising slogan (i.e. audio in addition to vision) during media multitasking results in lower salience of manipulative intent compared to an atypical slogan (i.e. silent) and positively impacts on brand attitude. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Advertising Slogans; Brand Attitude; Manipulative Intent; Media Multitasking; Persuasion Knowledge Model; Marketing; Advertizing; Advertizing Slogan; Atypicals; Brand Attitude; Emerging Technologies; Knowledge Model; Manipulative Intent; Medium Multitasking; Persuasion Knowledge Model; Single Screen; Multitasking,Marketing; Advertizing; Advertizing slogan; Atypicals; Brand attitude; Emerging technologies; Knowledge model; Manipulative intent; Medium multitasking; Persuasion knowledge model; Single screen; Multitasking,,,The authors thank Pascal Bierbaumer for his help in collecting the data.,"Advances in Consumer Research, (1999); Ang, Sweehoon, The ad creativity cube: conceptualization and initial validation, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 35, 2, pp. 220-232, (2007); Angell, Rob J., Don't Distract Me When I'm Media Multitasking: Toward a Theory for Raising Advertising Recall and Recognition, Journal of Advertising, 45, 2, pp. 198-210, (2016); Angell, Rob J., News you can use!

It describes in three stages the rich creative process shared between a humorist and an audience. This starts with the perception and/or formation of an amusing stimulus by a humorist and passes in a second stage to its communication by the humorist to others and their processing of the stimulus. The third stage captures the range of experiences and responses by the recipient/s, including personal consequences and possible re-use of the humor (which creates further functions and consequences). Although experiencing and using humor are both holistic processes, dependent on synchronization of social behaviors by humorist and recipient, the schema simplifies in order to summarize the general outline of a typical shared humorous 'transaction' while allowing for complex detail within each stage. It offers a framework within which scholars and practitioners can locate their different foci of research and application. It aims to assist in developing a shared vocabulary of concepts and terminology to foster exchange across the many disciplines involved in humor research.

Brand-driven, experiential and consistent online customer experiences are critical in this context, and it is a brand's website that operates as a hub for its online presence. Understanding how websites can offer online customer experiences that will lead to the desired consumer responses is fundamental. Even though significant research exists regarding online customer experiences on websites, it is highly fragmented across the business and IT literature. Most studies either separately examine the stages of the customer journey or simultaneously examine more than one stages. There have been no attempts to critically review and synthesize the existing body of knowledge regarding how online customer experiences are constructed on websites and their subsequent consumer responses in each separate stage of the customer journey. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap by synthesizing existing knowledge through a systematic literature review method and providing an overall direction for managing such online customer experiences. The findings indicate under-explored areas and serve as a resource for future studies and practice. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Consumer Response; Customer Journey; Literature Review; Online Customer Experience; Tccm; Website; Sales; Consumer Response; Customer Experience; Customer Journey; Immersive; Literature Reviews; Online Customer Experience; Online Customers; Personalizations; Research Agenda; Tccm; Websites,Sales; Consumer Response; Customer experience; Customer journey; Immersive; Literature reviews; Online customer experience; Online customers; Personalizations; Research agenda; TCCM; Websites,,,,"Adjei, Mavis T., The influence of C2C communications in online brand communities on customer purchase behavior, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 38, 5, pp. 634-653, (2010); Ahn, Daehwan, Which group do you want to travel with?

Despite their many potential benefits, interactions with chatbots may still feel machine-like and cold. The current study proposes the use of humour by chatbots as a gateway to humanizing them and thereby enhancing the customer experience. Across three experimental studies, the results reveal that (i) the use of humour enhances service satisfaction when it is used by a chatbot but not when it is used by a human agent, (ii) this chatbot humour effect is serially mediated by enhanced perceptions of anthropomorphism and interestingness of the interactions with the chatbot, and (iii) whilst both positively and negatively valenced chatbot humour may enhance the interestingness of the interactions, socially appropriate (i.e., affiliative) humour as opposed to inappropriate (i.e., aggressive) humour leads to enhanced service satisfaction. This study extends the understanding of the humanization processes of chatbots and provides guidelines for how firms should use chatbot humour to positively influence consumers' service satisfaction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Anthropomorphism; Artificial Intelligence; Chatbot; Customer Service; Humour; Service Satisfaction,,,,,"Aaker, Jennifer Lynn, Dimensions of brand personality, Journal of Marketing Research, 34, 3, pp. 347-356, (1997); Aggarwal, Pankaj, Is that car smiling at me?

Digital content can greatly impact public perception of gender roles and stereotypes, leading researchers to examine gender portrayals in digital ads for service brands in Vietnam. A content analysis of 300 digital service commercials found that female characters were more prominent than male ones and were often depicted in multiple roles. However, recent ads increasingly portrayed collaboration between female and male characters, and femvertising messages were conveyed more often. Despite these positive changes, gender stereotypes in digital advertising persist.

Evidence is needed to show whether advertising has indeed become more ethnically diverse over time, whether any cultural differences exist, and whether ethnic diversity in advertising in new media differs from that in traditional media advertisements. Building on extant research and social role theory, this study provides two empirical studies, a meta-analysis and content analysis, and questions commonly held beliefs in the diversity literature. The findings show that any increase in ethnic minority representation in advertising is fully captured by the fact that ethnic minorities in the general population have increased and that relevant changes have occurred only in Eastern societies where the overrepresentation of the white minority has decreased. Ethnic minorities are well represented in online and TV media but not in print media. Except for the product use of ethnic minority endorsers, stereotyping prevails and barely differs between old and new media.

Consequently, advertising, promotion and more generally marketing communications going through a major digital metamorphosis. Further, the rise of Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), digital marketing and advertising breaks the boundary between the physical world and the digital world. By means of these technologies, advertising may achieve a new level of promotion, branding and consumer involvement. Therefore, it deems essential to investigate the relationship between AR advertising and consumer behavior as well as their overall experience with AR. It would be imperative to explore the relationship between this new digital technology and consumers, so as to predict future trends in the development of advertising.

Although science jokes are pervasive on social media, we are only beginning to understand the mechanisms through which humor affects people’s attitudes, opinions, and perceptions of scientific topics. Here, we add to our understanding of how funny science content influences attitude formation and behavioral intentions; these results can help communicators make strategic decisions related to humor’s use in real-world practice. Extending recent work in science communication, this study aims to understand the conditional nature of the mechanism by which funny images about three different scientific topics, combined with verbal humor, affects people’s social media engagement intentions by eliciting mirth. Our results offer evidence that choices about which humor types to employ matter when it comes to communicating scientific topics. For two of the three topics, artificial intelligence and microbiomes, exposure to different humor types resulted in different levels of mirth and humor’s effect on engagement intentions was moderated by respondents’ need for humor. However, humor did not have the same effect on global warming engagement intentions.

Delivery time and tone of language in advertisements (ads) are two little explored characteristics in mobile advertising. This paper examines how morning delivery and the use of a friendly language tone in ads are related to customer purchase intention. Based on survey data from the U.S. population, morning ads with a friendly tone are less irritating and positively influence customer attitude toward mobile learning from the ads, which result in increasing consumer purchase intention. In other words, morning and friendly-toned ads have a positive indirect impact on purchase intention. This research contributes to the body of literature on mobile marketing by providing empirical evidence on the value of delivery time and language tone of mobile communication because such delivery avoids irritating users and increases purchase intention.

The current study uses a 2 (persuasive appeal: fear vs. humor) x 3 (message repetition) mixed factorial experiment to investigate the effectiveness of persuasive appeals (on intentions to purchase medications online via social media referrals, mediated by psychological reactance (threat to freedom and anger), attitudes toward the public service announcements (PSAs), and viral behavioral intentions. ANOVA results showed the superiority of humor appeals compared to fear appeals in (1) reducing psychological reactance, (2) igniting favorable responses to the PSA, and (3) marginally reducing the intentions to purchase medications vial social media despite lower online engagement intentions (viral behavioral intentions).

A moderated serial mediation model, conducted using PROCESS models, was examined to assess the mechanism by which persuasive appeals and risk perceptions interact in influencing purchase intentions.

However, the recipe for creating a viral meme remains obscure. This study makes a phenomenological contribution by examining viral memes, exploring the antecedents (i.e., content-related factors, customer-related factors, and media-related factors), consequences, and moderating factors using a mixed-method approach. The study presents a holistic framework for creating viral memes based on the perceptions of customers and industry stakeholders. Four quantitative studies (i.e., a lab experiment, an online quasi-experiment, an event study, and a brand recall study) validate the theoretical model identified in the qualitative study. The research underlines the potential of viral memes in marketing communications as they enhance brand recall and brand engagement. The study found that viral memes are topical and highly relatable and are thus well received by the target groups, which increases customer engagement and brand recall. Marketers can adopt the findings of this study to design content for memes that consumers find relevant, iconic, humorous, and spreadable. Furthermore, marketers can use customer-related factors suggested in the theoretical framework for enhancing escapism, social gratification, and content gratification for their target customers which in turn shall organically increase their reach within their target segments and enhance brand performance in terms of brand recall and brand engagement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Engagement; Meme Marketing; Memes; Memetic; Virality,,,,,"Attardo, Salvatore, Timing in the performance of jokes, Humor, 24, 2, pp. 233-250, (2011); Axelrod, Robert M., Schema Theory: An Information Processing Model of Perception and Cognition, American Political Science Review, 67, 4, pp. 1248-1266, (1973); Azar, Salim L., Motivations to interact with brands on Facebook - Towards a typology of consumer-brand interactions, Journal of Brand Management, 23, 2, pp. 153-178, (2016); undefined, (2011); undefined, (2020); Benaim, Mickaël, From symbolic values to symbolic innovation: Internet-memes and innovation, Research Policy, 47, 5, pp. 901-910, (2018); Borah, Abhishek, Improvised Marketing Interventions in Social Media, Journal of Marketing, 84, 2, pp. 69-91, (2020); Brodie, Roderick J., Customer engagement: Conceptual domain, fundamental propositions, and implications for research, Journal of Service Research, 14, 3, pp. 252-271, (2011); Brubaker, Pamela Jo, One does not simply meme about organizations: Exploring the content creation strategies of user-generated memes on Imgur, Public Relations Review, 44, 5, pp. 741-751, (2018); World Scientific News, (2016)",,John Wiley and Sons Inc,,,,,,07426046; 15206793,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85131358845

However, this advanced technology is not immune to mistakes. The current research focuses on whether humor could be an effective recovery method in robot failure. Drawing on benign violation theory and regulatory focus theory, two experiments are conducted to demonstrate that, in low-severity failure conditions, humorous responses lead to higher humor appreciation and more positive customer evaluations. However, in high-severity failure conditions, humorous responses lead to higher perceived insincerity and more negative customer evaluations. We also examine the moderating role of anthropomorphism.

However, the core elements of a story that translate to positive consumer attitudes are not fully understood. This study aims at understanding the attitudes of consumers toward storytelling video advertisements that contain humor and drama as their principal elements and how they translate to brand attitudes. Three stimuli-based experimental studies were conducted via Mturk. Study 1 (n = 232) was aimed at understanding the effect of affective reaction and cognitive evaluation on the attitude toward storytelling humorous advertisements. Study 2 (n = 252) considered the effect of the same variables on the attitude toward storytelling dramatic advertisements. Study 3 (n = 284) aimed at understanding the effects of attitude toward humorous and dramatic storytelling advertisements on the attitude toward the brand. Results indicated that the most significant driver of attitude toward humorous storytelling advertisements is affective reaction, whereas cognitive evaluation influences attitude toward dramatic storytelling advertisements. Attitude toward humorous storytelling advertisements contributes more to brand attitude formation than dramatic storytelling advertisements.

Artificial intelligence has been proved as one of the innovative tools of digitalization to change consumer's media habits. Owing to the growing trends of e-commerce, the traditional advertising model is insufficient. Therefore, advertisers are taking advantage of artificial intelligence technology to meet current requirements. Thus, a deeper understanding of product advertisement with reference to consumer sentiments and its implications need to be established. The current research depicts the contribution of artificial intelligence to analyze the consumers' attention, cognition, and emotion. The target product was Samsung Galaxy. Researcher of the current study has employed Think-aloud procedure for data analysis. Tweets dataset was divided into 2 categories. For international consumers' sentiments 30,877 tweets whereas for Pakistani consumers' sentiments tweets dataset was 26,834. For data analysis, authors used Nvivo for generating theme. The Nvivo produced word cloud. The word cloud generated with Pakistani tweets revealed that consumer attachment with Samsung product is based on emotional and attention and the preferred features of Samsung products are linked with emotional and attention. In contrary to that rest of the world tweets unfolded that emotion, attention, and cognition make consumer preferences while selecting Samsung products. This study is useful to the cellular companies for targeting across the world population. The consumer preference varies while selecting cell phones. This study will provide a better idea to cell phone companies for manufacturing consumer oriented cell phones to get better results. Moreover, future research should add more countries separate data and generate a comparative study between developed countries consumer and developing countries consumer preferences. In addition to companies with better insights of consumer can highlight the most attractive features of cell phone in their advertisements. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Attention; Cognition; Emotion; Pakistan; Product Advertisement; Qualitative Research; Think-aloud; Tweets,,,,"This work was funded by Business School, Shandong Jianzhu University, China to HS.","Abbasi, Ahmed Ali, Text analytics to support sense-making in social media: A language-action perspective, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 42, 2, pp. 427-464, (2018); Achar, Chethana, What we feel and why we buy: The influence of emotions on consumer decision-making, Current Opinion in Psychology, 10, pp. 166-170, (2016); Adamopoulos, Panagiotis Panos, The impact of user personality traits on word of mouth: Text-mining social media platforms, Information Systems Research, 29, 3, pp. 612-640, (2018); Afak for Science Journal, (2021); Araujo, Theo B., Getting the word out on Twitter: The role of influentials, information brokers and strong ties in building word-of-mouth for brands, International Journal of Advertising, 36, 3, pp. 496-513, (2017); Bagwell, Kyle W., Chapter 28 The Economic Analysis of Advertising, Handbook of Industrial Organization, 3, pp. 1701-1844, (2007); Bakalash, Tomer, Exploring ad-elicited emotional arousal and memory for the ad using fMRI, Journal of Advertising, 42, 4, pp. 275-291, (2013); Bang, Hyejin, Tracking users' visual attention and responses to personalized advertising based on task cognitive demand, Computers in Human Behavior, 55, pp. 867-876, (2016); Bartels, Daniel M., Connecting cognition and consumer choice, Cognition, 135, pp. 47-51, (2015); Becker, Ingo F., Cross-Industrial User Channel Preferences on the Path to Online Purchase: Homogeneous, Heterogeneous, or Mixed?, Journal of Advertising, 46, 2, pp. 248-268, (2017)",,Frontiers Media S.A.,,,,,,16641078,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133524101

How should brands reply to such incivility while maintaining their positions and protecting their reputations? Two common types of reply include either a sarcastic or an assertive tone, but the effects of these types of communication on consumers’ attitudes toward brands remain largely unexplored. Results from a series of five studies exploring different causes (LGBT+ phobia, sexism, and racial equity) show that consumers evaluate brands that reply using an assertive tone more favorably than those using a sarcastic tone, which can be partially explained by the perceived aggressiveness of sarcasm. Additionally, support for a brand's stance acts as a boundary condition on the effect the type of reply adopted by the brand has on consumer attitudes toward the brand. So, the more someone supports a brand's stance, the less their perception of aggressiveness will negatively influence their attitude to that brand. We discuss the implications of these findings for marketing theory and practice. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Assertiveness; Attitude Toward Brands; Brand Activism; Incivility; Sarcasm; Social Media,,,,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by FGV EAESP Pesquisa; and São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) grant #2019/01390-3.","Journal of Marketing, (1990); Alexander, Richard D., Ostracism and indirect reciprocity: The reproductive significance of humor, Ethology and Sociobiology, 7, 3-4, pp. 253-270, (1986); Anderson, Ashley A., The ""nasty effect:"" online incivility and risk perceptions of emerging technologies, Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, 19, 3, pp. 373-387, (2014); Anderson, Ashley A., Social Media, Science, and Attack Discourse: How Twitter Discussions of Climate Change Use Sarcasm and Incivility, Science Communication, 39, 5, pp. 598-620, (2017); Ang, Lawrence, Single versus multiple measurement of attitudes: A meta-analysis of advertising studies validates the single-item measure approach, Journal of Advertising Research, 58, 2, pp. 218-227, (2018); Attardo, Salvatore, Irony as relevant inappropriateness, Journal of Pragmatics, 32, 6, pp. 793-826, (2000); Bacile, Todd J., Digital customer service and customer-to-customer interactions: investigating the effect of online incivility on customer perceived service climate, Journal of Service Management, 31, 3, pp. 441-464, (2020); Bacile, Todd J., The value disruption of uncivil other-customers during online service recovery, Journal of Services Marketing, 34, 4, pp. 483-498, (2020); Bacile, Todd J., The Effects of Online Incivility and Consumer-to-Consumer Interactional Justice on Complainants, Observers, and Service Providers During Social Media Service Recovery, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 44, pp. 60-81, (2018); Bate, Barbara, Assertive Speaking: An Approach To Communication Education For The Future, Communication Education, 25, 1, pp. 53-59, (1976)",,SAGE Publications Ltd,,,,,,10949968; 15206653,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128320614

To this end, we present the results from a preregistered, direct replication of C. Skurka, J. Niederdeppe, R. Romero-Canyas, and D. Acup (2018). The original study found that a threat appeal about climate change can increase risk perception and activism intentions and that a humor appeal can also increase activism intentions with a large sample of young adults. Using the same stimuli, measures, and experimental design with a similar sample, we fail to replicate these main effects. We do, however, replicate age as a moderator of humor’s effect on perceived risk, such that the humor appeal only persuaded emerging adults (ages 18–21.9). We consider several explanations for our discrepant findings, including the challenges (and opportunities) that persuasion researchers must navigate when communicating about rapidly evolving social issues. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Climate Change; Humor Appeal; Persuasion; Replication; Threat Appeal; Young Adults,,,,,"Do Younger Generations Care More about Global Warming, (2019); Communication Yearbook, (1984); Boukes, Mark, At Odds: Laughing and Thinking?

In celebration of JA’s 50th anniversary, this article presents an in-depth retrospective of the journal and compares it with the other leading advertising journals, such as Journal of Advertising Research (JAR), International Journal of Advertising (IJA), and Journal of Current Issues and Research in Advertising (JCIRA). To do so, this article conducts a bibliometric review using performance analysis and natural language processing (NLP) as a means for co-word analysis on bibliometric information retrieved from Scopus. Using performance analysis, this article demonstrates that JA is the leading advertising journal in terms of research influence (h-index) and impact (g-index), as the journal receives the highest average and total citations despite publishing 11% less than its closest peers (JAR and IJA). Using NLP as a means for co-word analysis, this article reveals eight clusters or themes (1972–2020) that avail in JA’s body of knowledge (i.e., advertising appeals, advertising involvement, advertising credibility, advertising brands, advertising impact, advertising modeling and strategies, advertising communication and engagement, and advertising response) as well as nine clusters or themes (2000–2020) that reflect the four leading advertising journals’ collective contributions to the body of advertising knowledge (i.e., community advertising, responsible advertising, digital and social media advertising, product placement advertising, advertising impact, advertising credibility and persuasiveness, gamification and signaling in advertising, sponsorship advertising, and attitudes toward advertising).

Based on Speck’s taxonomy of humour, this research aims to clarify whether online brand humour advertisements have an impact on consumer engagement on a visual social media platform like Instagram. This chapter analyses the influence of comic wit and satire on product involvement, brand familiarity and gender, and their impact on online consumer engagement on the social network platform. A survey was developed and distributed online and a total of 216 participants from Qatar voluntarily filled out the questionnaire. Data was then analysed using SPSS and structural equation modelling.

All participants (N = 147) interact with an omnidirectional video clip in three different conditions (VR, 360º, 2D). Throughout the two experimental sessions, affective, cognitive, and behavioural information is collected from the participant, which allows us to relate their interactive behaviour, their perception of presence and degree of entertainment. The possible influence of experience with interactive systems on current interactive behaviour is also analysed. The results highlight the complex relationships between these nuclear dimensions of VR and indicate the existence of two types of exploratory behaviour that we have called interface dependent and interface independent. When the first is present, there is no connection with the positive perception of presence and entertainment, but there is in the second.

Although an extensive amount of research has been developed in B2C and B2B marketing context, few social media studies take a dive into potential linkages between external and internal marketing contexts in an industry specific paradigm. This study aims to bridge B2C and B2B social media marketing, by adopting the outside-in perspective as theoretical lens. Using a large-scale dataset, collected from a micro-blogging site, and consumer-oriented information assembled from multiple sources, we empirically examine the inter-relationship between firm-generated messages, consumer digital engagement, and firm sales performance in the movie industry. Theoretically, this study builds upon the outside-in perspective and extends the current knowledge of the outside-in perspective to the social media context. It also bridges the B2C and B2B marketing literature by demonstrating that the insight garnered from B2C social media interactions should be integrated into the B2B firm interactions, communications, and decision makings.

Drawing on an archive of 310 non-commercial (i.e., not-for-profit and public) adjudication reports, we highlight the substantive norms and procedural mechanisms through which the ASA governs advertising complaints alleging offence and/or harm. Substantively, the ASA precludes potential normative transgressions by publishing, disseminating, consulting upon, and updating detailed codes of advertising conduct. Procedurally, the ASA adjudicates between allegations and justifications of offence and harm on a received complaint-by-complaint basis, often upon consequentialist grounds. Such consequentialism, we claim, has the effect of normalizing power imbalances between the ASA’s members, on the one hand, and wider stakeholders, on the other hand. The paper argues that, in the context of UK advertising, what Michel Foucault called the right ‘to be or not to be governed like that’ is enjoyed by relatively few subjects. Having demonstrated how UK advertising practices are governed, the paper closes with suggestions as to how they might be governed otherwise. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Advertising Ethics; Advertising Regulation; Offensiveness And Harmfulness,,,,"Funding text 1: This study was funded by the ESRC under Grant #1486352 and the University of Edinburgh College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences.

Brand type is regarded as a moderator in the research model, which is empirically evaluated using over 240,000 tweets across approximately 70 auto brands collected from Weibo. Manual coding and machine learning algorithms are integrated to develop a classification model that tags tweets. Results show that content factors (i.e., persuasive and informative cues) and source factors (i.e., brand popularity and reputation) have significant influence on consumers’ liking behavior toward advertisement tweets in microblogs. Source factors exert stronger effects on tweet liking than content factors. Particularly, brand popularity is more powerful in increasing the number of likes than brand reputation. In addition, we find that these relationships vary significantly depending on brand type. For functional brands, persuasive cues tend to result in more tweet likes, whereas source factors are more powerful for prestige brands in driving consumers to like their advertisement tweets. Our findings enhance the current understanding of consumers’ liking behavior on social media and provide managerial insights for brands seeking to facilitate consumer engagement. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Advertisement; Heuristic-systematic Model; Liking Behavior; Social Media; Source Credibility,,,,"This work is supported by the Major Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91846201), the Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71521001), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71801069, 71722010, 91746302, 71872060).","Aaker, Jennifer Lynn, Dimensions of brand personality, Journal of Marketing Research, 34, 3, pp. 347-356, (1997); Persuasive Advertising Evidence Based Principles, (2010); Baek, Tae Hyun, The differential roles of brand credibility and brand prestige in consumer brand choice, Psychology and Marketing, 27, 7, pp. 662-678, (2010); Baker, William E., An empirical test of an updated relevance-accessibility model of advertising effectiveness, Journal of Advertising, 29, 1, pp. X-13, (2000); Building Reliable Metaclassifiers for Text Learning, (2006); Berger, Jonah A., What makes online content viral?, Journal of Marketing Research, 49, 2, pp. 192-205, (2012); Bhattacherjee, Anol, Influence processes for information technology acceptance: An elaboration likelihood model, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 30, 4, pp. 805-825, (2006); Journal of Advertising Research, (1995); Microeconometrics Methods and Applications, (2005); Chaiken, Shelly, Heuristic versus systematic information processing and the use of source versus message cues in persuasion, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 39, 5, pp. 752-766, (1980)",,"California State University, Long Beach",,,,,,19389027; 15266133,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101625647

Design/methodology/approach: A content analysis of 40,679 posts on the official Instagram accounts of 15 global luxury brands was conducted. Findings: Brand posts using expressive aesthetic image received more likes and comments on Instagram than those with classical aesthetics. Brand video content received more likes and comments than static content. There was also a significant interaction between visual aesthetics and presentation modality in generating likes and comments. Brand content adopting expressive aesthetic and audio-visual modality generated more responses when using audio-visual modality, while content using classical aesthetics produced more responses in a visual-only format. Practical implications: As visual aesthetics and modality resulted in different responses to Instagram ads, luxury marketers should consider using appropriate approaches when creating brand posts on Instagram. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies examining the effectiveness of visual aesthetics and presentation modality in Instagram advertising, especially in luxury fashion brand context. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Content Analysis; Fashion; Instagram; Luxury Brand; Presentation Modality; Visual Aesthetics,,,,,"Alfakhri, Demah H., The role of aesthetics and design in hotelscape: A phenomenological investigation of cosmopolitan consumers, Journal of Business Research, 85, pp. 523-531, (2018); Advances in Luxury Brand Management, (2017); Baker, Jeff, The internet dilemma: An exploratory study of luxury firms’ usage of internet-based technologies, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 41, pp. 37-47, (2018); Belanche, Daniel, Understanding Interactive Online Advertising: Congruence and Product Involvement in Highly and Lowly Arousing, Skippable Video Ads, Journal of Interactive Marketing, 37, pp. 75-88, (2017); People Believe Ads are Becoming More Intrusive, (2018); Bhaduri, Gargi, Evaluation of absolute luxury: Effect of cues, consumers’ need for uniqueness, product involvement and product knowledge on expected price, Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management, 20, 4, pp. 471-486, (2016); Bhandari, Upasna, Understanding the impact of perceived visual aesthetics on user evaluations: An emotional perspective, Information and Management, 56, 1, pp. 85-93, (2019); Burgoon, Judee K., Testing the interactivity principle: Effects of mediation, propinquity, and verbal and nonverbal modalities in interpersonal interaction, Journal of Communication, 52, 3, pp. 657-677, (2002); Shun, Cai, Designing not just for pleasure: Effects of web site aesthetics on consumer shopping value, International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 15, 4, pp. 159-188, (2011); Blázquez, Marta, The influence of image interactivity upon user engagement when using mobile touch screens, Computers in Human Behavior, 77, pp. 406-412, (2017)",,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,,,,,,13612026,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073936485

The present study seeks to provide a deeper understanding of the challenges involved in the #MeToo movement by identifying the main issues regarding business and marketing activities. To this end, the analysis of user-generated content (UGC) on Twitter was performed to extract the tweets with the hashtag “#MeToo” (31,305 tweets). Then, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model was applied to this database to identify topics. In the next step, using a Supervised Vector Machine (SVM) type analysis, we classified the tweets according to the sentiment they express (positive, negative, and neutral). Finally, we performed data text mining using the NVivo software. Our findings underscore the importance of (i) gender equality in communication campaigns, (ii) gender equality at work and (iii) social mobilizations in social networks, as well as suggest that (iv) marketing advertisers should become more inclusive and respectful in their advertising and marketing campaigns. The identified topics may be a starting point for future research on social movements, sociology, sexuality, or machismo in work environment, business and marketing strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",#metoo; Computer Science; Data Text Mining; Sentiment Analysis; Sexual Harassment; Social Media Content; Twitter; User Generated Content,,,,This research study was the result of a research stay made by Ana Reyes-Menendez and Jose Ramon Saura in Universidade Portucalense (Porto) funded by 2019 Mobility Grant for Teaching and Research staff at Rey Juan Carlos University (Madrid) .,"Journal of Advertising Research, (1990); Abbar, Sofiane, You tweet what you eat: Studying food consumption through twitter, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, 2015-April, pp. 3197-3206, (2015); Allcott, Hunt, Trends in the diffusion of misinformation on social media, Research and Politics, 6, 2, (2019); Proceeding of the 9th International Conference on Ubiquitous Information Management and Communication, (2015); Becatti, Carolina, Extracting significant signal of news consumption from social networks: the case of Twitter in Italian political elections, Palgrave Communications, 5, 1, (2019); Bekalu, Mesfin Awoke, Presupposition in news discourse, Discourse and Society, 17, 2, pp. 147-172, (2006); Current Perspectives in Feminist Media Studies, (2013); Blei, David M., Latent Dirichlet allocation, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 3, 4-5, pp. 993-1022, (2003); Bologna, Guido, Characterization of symbolic rules embedded in deep DIMLP networks: A challenge to transparency of deep learning, Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing Research, 7, 4, pp. 265-286, (2017); Brandt, Mark J., Sexism and gender inequality across 57 societies, Psychological Science, 22, 11, pp. 1413-1418, (2011)",,Elsevier Ltd,,,,,,24058440,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082112224

We studied the use of humor and fear appeals by a three-dimensional animated pedagogical agent that taught the same procedural knowledge in four conditions: i) humor appeal, ii) fear appeal, iii) humor, and fear appeal together, and iv) no emotion appeals. The agent delivered and illustrated the knowledge in an application for aviation safety education. The results of our study show that using the educational application had overall positive learning effects, regardless of the appeals used by the agent. Resort to humor and fear appeals by the agent affected instead participants' mood, liking of the application, and perception of the agent.

The most common way for brands to advertise in these videos is by means of overlay ads. The current paper investigates the effectiveness of such in-video ads. Based on prior studies on multi-modal information processing, we propose that the timing of showing the brand vs. the humorous build-up may be crucial. In two 4-condition (showing the brand at the joke’s start, immediately before, simultaneous to, and immediately after the punch line) between-subjects experiments (N = 109; N = 394), participants assessed brand recall, brand-logo recognition, brand attitudes, and purchase intentions after exposure to an overlay ad of a soda brand during a humorous (stand-up) video. Results show the importance of timing: confirming our expectations, showing the brand simultaneous to the punch line reduced recall (Study 1) and logo recognition (Studies 1 and 2). In contrast, showing the brand simultaneous to (Study 1) or immediately before (Study 2) the punch line improved brand attitudes and purchase intentions. Results indicate that the optimal timing of an overlay ad during a humorous video depends on the advertiser’s goals: increasing brand awareness or improving brand attitudes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Advertising; Humor; Overlay; Timing; Youtube,,,,This study was supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO/VIDI grant 276-45-005).,"Journal of Marketing, (1993); Journal of Consumer Research, (1985); Attardc, Salvatore, Script theory revis(it)ed: Joke similarity and joke representation model, Humor, 4, 3-4, pp. 293-348, (1991); Becker, Amy B., When Political Comedy Turns Personal: Humor Types, Audience Evaluations, and Attitudes, Howard Journal of Communications, 25, 1, pp. 34-55, (2014); Marketing Scales Handbook A Compilation of Multi Item Measures, (1992); Buijzen, Moniek, Developing a typology of humor in audiovisual media, Media Psychology, 6, 2, pp. 147-167, (2004); Burke, Moira K., High-cost banner blindness: Ads increase perceived workload, hinder visual search, and are forgotten, ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction, 12, 4, pp. 423-445, (2005); Casler, Krista, Separate but equal?

The providers of such video services have developed mobile capabilities and have worked to increase their video selections. This study investigates the effect of the factors of preview content (the thumbnail and the title) and context (the popularity cue and the serial position) on video selection in a mobile context by adopting dual process theory and the model of attention capture and transfer. We performed a logit transformation on the dependent variable, and then applied generalized least squares (GLS) regression to analyze 206,221 logs and 323 thumbnails and titles of a video service. Image and text- mining techniques were used to ascertain the level of valence and response to content. This study has four main findings: (1) low valence but high arousal of a thumbnail has a positive effect on video selection; (2) high valence and arousal by a title has a positive effect on video selection; (3) the upper serial position of a video clip and a high popularity cue have a positive effect on the video selection; and (4) the length and recency of a video have a positive effect on the video selection.

Now in its seventh edition, the book continues its exploration of how our experiences with media affect the way we acquire and process knowledge about the world and how this knowledge influences our attitudes and behavior. Updates include end-of-chapter suggestions for further reading, new research and examples for a more global perspective, as well as an added emphasis on the power of social media in affecting our perceptions of reality and ourselves. While including real-world examples, the book also integrates psychology and communication theory along with reviews of the most up-to-date research. The text covers a diversity of media forms and issues, ranging from commonly discussed topics such as politics, sex, and violence, to lesser-studied topics, such as emotions and prosocial media. Readers will be challenged to become more sensitized and to think more deeply about their own media use as they explore research on behavior and media effects. Written in an engaging, readable style, the text is appropriate for graduate or undergraduate audiences. The accompanying companion website also includes resources for both instructors and students.

For this purpose, a study was designed to compare and contrast behaviour patterns across Brazilian and British cultures. An advergame (Colheita de Café (CC)), featuring the Fairtrade mark was developed through a semiotics approach. Participants from both Brazil (N = 30) and the UK (N = 34) were invited to play the advergame and answer a questionnaire before and after gameplay. The results indicate that Brazilians felt more familiar with the visual elements incorporated by the advergame when compared to British consumers. Brazilians also had more favourable attitudes towards the brand, suggesting that visual familiarity could influence consumer behaviour. Contrary to our expectations, both Brazilian and British respondents had the same attitudes towards the advergame, showing that visual familiarity did not particularly influence the advergame experience. The main contribution of this paper is the suggestion that visual familiarity could influence consumer behaviour across cultures. We expect that our findings can be used in future research that examines cultural nuances in advergame design. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Advergames; Brazil; Cross-cultural Hci; Culture; Semiotics; Uk; Cell Culture; Semiotics; Advergames; Behaviour Patterns; Brazil; Cross-cultural Hci; Exploratory Studies; Gameplay; Visual Elements; Consumer Behavior,Cell culture; Semiotics; Advergames; Behaviour patterns; Brazil; Cross-Cultural HCI; Exploratory studies; Gameplay; Visual elements; Consumer behavior,,,"Vanissa Wanick gratefully acknowledges Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES), Brazil, (number: 9520-13-9 ) for her PhD studentship.

The present study is an attempt to examine if these results would be replicated in service encounter settings with other characteristics. Two experiments were conducted, and the previous pattern was reproduced: customer satisfaction was reduced when employees told jokes compared to when jokes were not told. The results also indicate that employee joke-telling reduced both perceived relevance and positive affect, and that these two variables mediated the association between employee joke-telling and customer satisfaction. The results should be seen in contrast to several humor studies in an advertising context showing that humor-comprising ads can have positive effects on the receiver. One main reason for the differences is that a service encounter typically includes also other elements than humor in the employee's communication with a customer, and that employee humor usage attenuates the customer's attention to and comprehension of those other elements. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Public Attitude; Retailing; Service Quality,public attitude; retailing; service quality,,,,"Agarwal, Ritu, Time flies when you're having fun: Cognitive absorption and beliefs about information technology usage, MIS Quarterly: Management Information Systems, 24, 4, pp. 665-694, (2000); Alden, Dana Latham, An examination of cognitive factors related to humorousness in television advertising, Journal of Advertising, 22, 2, pp. 29-37, (1993); Ang, Sweehoon, The ad creativity cube: conceptualization and initial validation, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 35, 2, pp. 220-232, (2007); Beal, Daniel J., An episodic process model of affective influences on performance, Journal of Applied Psychology, 90, 6, pp. 1054-1068, (2005); Journal of Marketing, (1990); Boxer, Diana, From bonding to biting: Conversational joking and identity display, Journal of Pragmatics, 27, 3, pp. 275-294, (1997); Bressler, Eric R., The influence of humor on desirability, Evolution and Human Behavior, 27, 1, pp. 29-39, (2006); Bronnenberg, Bart J., Adolescence and the path to maturity in global retail, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 29, 4, pp. 113-134, (2015); Bryant, Jennings, Relationship between college teachers' use of humor in the classroom and students' evaluations of their teachers, Journal of Educational Psychology, 72, 4, pp. 511-519, (1980); Bryant, Jennings, EFFECTS OF HUMOROUS ILLUSTRATIONS IN COLLEGE TEXTBOOKS, Human Communication Research, 8, 1, pp. 43-57, (1981)",,Elsevier Ltd,,,,,,9696989,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044373536

This research focuses on message characteristics and more specifically the role of humour in encouraging likes, comments and reposts. Based on a sample of firm-initiated Weibo posts by a Chinese provincial destination marketing organization, it investigates whether humorous messages overall are more effective, and specifically whether image-based humour is more effective than text-based humour. It also considers whether a message contains a product focus and is complex in terms of its length, lexical density and inclusion of multimodal elements. The findings confirm the proposed influence of humour (with picture-based humour particularly effective), but suggest an even stronger impact of non-product related contents and also indicate that message simplicity is important for eliciting customer engagement. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Customer Engagement; Humour; Message Complexity; Message Delivery; Product Focus; Social Media Marketing,,,,,"Akdeniz, M.

The Psychology of Humor, 2e reviews the literature, integrating research from across subdisciplines in psychology, as well as related fields such as anthropology, biology, computer science, linguistics, sociology, and more. This book begins by defining humor and presenting theories of humor. Later chapters cover cognitive processes involved in humor and the effects of humor on cognition. Individual differences in personality and humor are identified as well as the physiology of humor, the social functions of humor, and how humor develops and changes over the lifespan. This book concludes noting the association of humor with physical and mental health, and outlines applications of humor use in psychotherapy, education, and the workplace. In addition to being fully updated with recent research, the second edition includes a variety of new materials. More graphs, tables, and figures now illustrate concepts, processes, and theories. It provides new brief interviews with prominent humor scholars via text boxes.

The erotic appeal is one of the most controversial emotional appeals. The use of sex appeal in advertising is influenced by several factors that need to be taken into consideration. Sex sells and perhaps that is why marketers consider it to be one of the most potent tools in advertising. One of the characteristics that sets Generation Y apart from earlier generations, and which is relevant for this research, is that they have reported greater liking of advertisements compared to previous generations and are less often offended, insulted and misled by advertising. The objective of this study is to verify whether sex sells. In selected advertising campaigns with an erotic undertone, it was tested whether the use of sex appeal in combination with a suitable product can increase the demand for such a product rather than in areas where there is no association of the product with sex appeal. The study also investigates whether men pay more attention to sex in advertising than women. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Advertising Appeals; Eye-tracking; Millennials; Information Management; Marketing; Advertising Campaign; Eye-tracking Studies; Generation Y; Millennials; Eye Tracking,Information management; Marketing; Advertising campaign; Eye-tracking studies; Generation Y; Millennials; Eye tracking,,,,"Alden, Dana Latham, Brand positioning through advertising in Asia, North America, and Europe: The role of global consumer culture, Journal of Marketing, 63, 1, pp. 75-87, (1999); Baumeister, Roy F., Is there a gender difference in strength of sex drive?

Study 1 (N = 63) found that for unfamiliar brands, SEAs were more effective in promoting favorable brand attitudes using both verbal (name) and visual (picture) virtual self cues than no self-endorsing at or only a picture of the self. Self-referencing, the psychological process of encoding new information by activating one's self schema, mediated self-endorsing and brand attitude. Study 2 (N = 75) manipulated the agency of SEA creation (i.e., self-versus other-created). Controlling for pre-existing brand attitudes, self-created SEAs elicited greater self-referencing for existing brands than other-created SEAs.

For the first time, a GfK-EMO Scan, a facial expression recognition software developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIs, is used to investigate the long-term effect of advertising on individual attitudes toward driving. The effects of high emotional and low emotional advertising were measured using the GfK-EMO software on 60 participants with a 50/50 male to female ratio. Each participant was subjected to either a high emotional or low emotional safe driving video advertisement. While watching the advertisement, the GfK-EMO facial recognition software recorded the unconscious emotions of participants who were also requested to fill a modified version of the National Survey of Speeding Attitudes and Behavior. A driving attitude score was then computed using this survey directly after the participant had viewed the advertisement and again two weeks later. Noticeable differences in the attitude score were recorded between participants having watched the high emotional advertisement against participants having watched the low emotional advertisement. The high emotional advertisement generated a higher and more durable safe driving attitude score in comparison to the low emotional advertisement. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Advertising; Driving Attitude; Emotional; Facial Recognition; Neuromarketing; Road Safety Campaigns; Advertising; Behavioral Response; Cognition; Marketing; Pattern Recognition; Software; Survey Method; Transportation Safety,advertising; behavioral response; cognition; marketing; pattern recognition; software; survey method; transportation safety,,,,"undefined, (2015); Attitudes Personality and Behaviour, (1988); Algom, Daniel, A rational look at the emotional stroop phenomenon: A generic slowdown, not a stroop effect, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 133, 3, pp. 323-338, (2004); Bakalash, Tomer, Exploring ad-elicited emotional arousal and memory for the ad using fMRI, Journal of Advertising, 42, 4, pp. 275-291, (2013); International Journal of Public Opinion Research, (2013); Marketing Communication Theory and Research, (1985); Journal of Marketing Research, (1990); Cook, Ian A., Regional brain activation with advertising images, Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology, and Economics, 4, 3, pp. 147-160, (2011); Xth Global Conference on Business and Economics, (2010); Di Vesta, Francis J., The pausing principle: Increasing the efficiency of memory for ongoing events, Contemporary Educational Psychology, 4, 3, pp. 288-296, (1979)",,Elsevier Ltd,,,,,,9696989,,,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012272839

However, little is known about contingencies under which different types of humor may or may not be effective. This experiment crossed humorous versus nonhumorous and self- versus other-deprecating messages about binge drinking, and tested how differences in personal investment in alcohol use moderates the effects of such messages on college binge drinkers. Results showed significant 3-way interaction effects on subjective norms and behavioral intentions largely consistent with hypotheses. Assessment of significant differences in the interactions indicated that for binge drinkers who were not high in personal investment in alcohol use, other-deprecating humor tended to reduce their perceived subjective norms about the acceptability of binge drinking behavior and their behavioral intentions. The effect of the experimental manipulation on subjective norms among these binge drinkers was shown to mediate the effect on intentions to binge drink in the future.

This paper explores the relationship between the number of views and how persuasive the ad is at convincing consumers to purchase or to adopt a favorable attitude towards the product. The analysis combines data on the total views of 400 video ads, and crowd-sourced measurement of advertising persuasiveness among 24,000 survey responses. Persuasiveness is measured by randomly exposing half of these consumers to a video ad and half to a similar placebo video ad, and then surveying their attitudes towards the focal product. Relative ad persuasiveness is on average 10% lower for every one million views that the video ad achieves. The exceptions to this pattern were ads that generated views and large numbers of comments, and video ads that attracted comments that mentioned the product by name. Evidence suggests that such ads remained effective because they attracted views due to humor rather than because they were outrageous. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Internet; Video Advertising; Viral Advertising; Virality,,,,,"Ai, Chunrong, Interaction terms in logit and probit models, Economics Letters, 80, 1, pp. 123-129, (2003); Aral, Sinan, Creating social contagion through viral product design: A randomized trial of peer influence in networks, Management Science, 57, 9, pp. 1623-1639, (2011); Barnes, James H., An exploratory investigation into the nature of offensive television advertising, Journal of Advertising, 19, 3, pp. 61-69, (1990); Predicting Behavior from Intention-to-Buy Measures: The Parametric Case, 32, 2, pp. 176-191; Berger, Jonah A., What makes online content viral?, Journal of Marketing Research, 49, 2, pp. 192-205, (2012); Bertrand, Marianne, How much should we trust differences-in-differences estimates?, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 119, 1, pp. 249-275, (2004); Journal of Advertising Research, (1990); Brown, Mark R., The impact of comedic violence on viral advertising effectiveness, Journal of Advertising, 39, 1, pp. 49-66, (2010); Chen, Yubo, Online social interactions: A natural experiment on word of mouth versus observational learning, Journal of Marketing Research, 48, 2, pp. 238-254, (2011); Chen, Yuxin, A theory of combative advertising, Marketing Science, 28, 1, pp. 1-19, (2009)",,INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences shannon.leyhe@informs.org,,,,,,1526548X; 07322399,,,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925301546

The arousal stems from surprise, and is computed as a marginal entropy using information theory. The appraisal assigns meaning, by which the surprise is resolved, and is computed as a posterior probability using Bayesian theory. This model is tested by obtaining human ratings of surprise, meaning, and creativeness for artifacts in a domain of advertising design. The empirical results show that humans do judge creativeness as a product of surprise and meaning, consistent with the computational model of arousal and appraisal. Implications of the model are discussed with respect to advancing artificial intelligence in the arts as well as improving the computational evaluation of creativity in engineering and design. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Aesthetics; Bayesian; Creativity; Information; Semantics; Artificial Intelligence; Bayesian Networks; Information Theory; Petroleum Reservoir Evaluation; Semantics; Aesthetics; Bayesian; Computational Evaluation; Computational Model; Creativity; Information; Marginal Entropy; Posterior Probability; Computation Theory,Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Information theory; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Semantics; Aesthetics; Bayesian; Computational evaluation; Computational model; Creativity; Information; Marginal entropy; Posterior probability; Computation theory,,,,"Baddeley, Alan D., Working memory, Science, 255, 5044, pp. 556-559, (1992); Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, (1763); Aesthetica Einfuhrung in Die Neue Aesthetik, (1965); Berlyne, Daniel E., Uncertainty and conflict: A point of contact between information-theory and behavior-theory concepts, Psychological Review, 64, 6 PART 1, pp. 329-339, (1957); Berlyne, Daniel E., COMPLEXITY AND INCONGRUITY VARIABLES AS DETERMINANTS OF EXPLORATORY CHOICE AND EVALUATIVE RATINGS., Canadian journal of psychology, 17, pp. 274-290, (1963); Berlyne, Daniel E., Novelty, complexity, and hedonic value, Perception and Psychophysics, 8, 5, pp. 279-286, (1970); Aesthetics and Psychobiology, (1971); Besemer, Susan P., Creative product analysis matrix: Testing the model structure and a comparison among products - Three novel chairs, Creativity Research Journal, 11, 4, pp. 333-346, (1998); Besemer, Susan P., Analyzing Creative Products: Refinement and Test of a Judging Instrument, Journal of Creative Behavior, 20, 2, pp. 115-126, (1986); Besemer, Susan P., Confirming the three-factor creative product analysis matrix model in an American sample, Creativity Research Journal, 12, 4, pp. 287-296, (1999)",,Cambridge University Press,,,,,,08900604; 14691760,,AIEME,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921313373

FaceReader scores were associated with self-reports of the advertisement's effectiveness. Building on work describing the role of emotions in marketing research, we examined the relationship between the patterns of the FEBE and the perceived amusement of the advertisements, attitude toward the advertisement (AAD) and attitude toward the brand (AB). Differences were observed between FEH scores in response to high-, medium-, and low-amusing video advertisements (AVAs). Positive correlations were found between FEH and AAD and FEH and AB in high-and medium-but not in low-AVAs. As hypothesized, other basic emotions (sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust) did not predict advertisement amusement or advertisements' effectiveness. FaceReader enabled a detailed analysis of more than 120,000 frames of video-recordings contributing to an identification of global patterns of facial reactions to amusing persuasive stimuli. For amusing commercials, context-specific FEH features were found to be the major indicators of advertisement effectiveness. The study used video-recordings of participants in their natural environments obtained through a crowd-sourcing platform. The naturalistic design of the study strengthened its ecological validity and demonstrated the robustness of the software algorithms even under austere conditions.

The model disentangles the effects of social categorization, stereotype activation, and speech processing that jointly influence different business-related outcomes. The model highlights three categories of factors that moderate these accent effects, namely sender, receiver, and communication variables.

Think-aloud concurrent protocols obtained from each team's copywriter, art director, and the two working together were analyzed to examine the creative process and its relationship to the created advertisement. Interpretive analyses of the protocols reveal that the teams access culturally available plot patterns but in different ways. In this study and with the particular materials and situational context explored here, four of the five teams chose to pursue a single mythic structure to the apparent detriment of their final product. Only one team engaged in fully diversified idea generation involving a wide range of alternative scenarios.
